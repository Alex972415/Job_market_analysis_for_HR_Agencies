16. the month of publication influences the popularity of the job posting.

### Recommendations that can be given to an HR agency:
1. Do not try to focus on the field of activity (Manual tester, Java developer, QA engineer, etc.) when selecting vacancies, since this is not the main factor determining the popularity of a vacancy.
2. First of all, take jobs with the option of remote work, especially those that are offered for large cities such as Moscow, St. Petersburg,
 Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod.
3. Try to hire vacancies with the option of full-time employment.
4. Try to publish fewer vacancies in January, May, June, July, August.
5. If possible, set the amount of the proposed salary above the national average.
6. Try to hire vacancies where they are ready to consider candidates without experience.
7. Try to hire vacancies with the option of an employment contract.
8. Do not seek to take vacancies from accredited IT companies, as this is not the main factor determining the popularity of a vacancy.
