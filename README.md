### Task description:
This project presents data on vacancies from HR agencies that they worked with from January to December 2023. The aim of the project is to help the agency identify the key signs of a vacancy that affect its popularity in order to help the agency effectively plan work for 2024.
### Skills and tools

### Conclusions:
1. The mandatory requirements in the vacancy do not affect its popularity.
2. There is still no direct connection between the type of vacancy and its popularity.
3. It is impossible to say that there is a connection between the source of the vacancy and its popularity.
4. It is impossible to say that there is a connection between the number of cities in which a vacancy is offered and its popularity.
5. The presence of Moscow in the list of offered cities in a vacancy does not affect its popularity.
6. The presence of at least one of the 5 largest Russian cities in the list of suggested cities in the vacancy does not affect its popularity.
7. The presence of salary information in the job posting does not affect its popularity.
8. Having a remote work option in a job vacancy affects its popularity.
9. The presence of a full-time option in a job posting affects its popularity.
10. The specified salary in a job posting does not affect its popularity.
11. The required experience stated in the job posting affects its popularity.
12. If a job posting offers the possibility of remote work in one of the five largest cities in Russia, it affects its popularity.
13. If a job posting is labeled as entry-level, it does not affect its popularity.
14. More popular job postings were likely closed by the agency, but we cannot assert this with 100% certainty.
15. No direct relationship between the status of a job posting and its popularity
16. The month of publication influences the popularity of the job posting.

### Recommendations that can be given to an HR agency:
1. Do not try to focus on the field of activity (Manual tester, Java developer, QA engineer, etc.) when selecting vacancies, since this is not the main factor determining the popularity of a vacancy.
2. First of all, take jobs with the option of remote work, especially those that are offered for large cities such as Moscow, St. Petersburg,
 Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod.
3. Try to hire vacancies with the option of full-time employment.
4. Try to publish fewer vacancies in January, May, June, July, August.
5. If possible, set the amount of the proposed salary above the national average.
6. Try to hire vacancies where they are ready to consider candidates without experience.
7. Try to hire vacancies with the option of an employment contract.
8. Do not seek to take vacancies from accredited IT companies, as this is not the main factor determining the popularity of a vacancy.
